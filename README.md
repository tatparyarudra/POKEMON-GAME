## 🧩 About This Project

This game was fully built from scratch by myself.  
I created it as a fun project to practice core Python programming skills like loops, conditionals, random number generation, and basic game logic.

It started as a simple idea and grew into a playable text-adventure where players can enjoy a battle experience inside the terminal!
